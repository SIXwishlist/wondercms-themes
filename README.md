### How to create theme in 8 easy steps
- https://github.com/robiso/wondercms/wiki/Create-theme-in-8-easy-steps

### How to submit a theme
1. Create a theme and upload it to GitHub.

2. Create a ZIP file of your theme folder and upload it as a release on GitHub.
   - for example, you can check out our themes releases https://github.com/robiso/wondercms-themes/releases
   
3. IMPORTANT: Make sure your ZIP file is created in a way so the user can simply unzip and upload it to their themes folder. Test it with the built in WonderCMS theme installer (Settings->Themes & plugins).

4. Notify us
   - via GitHub or the WonderCMS community https://www.wondercms.com/forum
   - make a pull request to this README and add your theme ZIP link to the list above.

5. All tested and approved themes will be submitted and added to the list above.
   - Approved themes will also be featured in the official WonderCMS demo.
